# Eschaton for Ruby


An attempt to adapt the game of Eschaton, from David Foster Wallace's [*Infinite Jest*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest), into a text-based Ruby game. Definitely a work in progress. Not much to look at now, but I'll update the README when the game gets a little more involved.


To install:

    gem install eschaton

To play:

    eschaton
